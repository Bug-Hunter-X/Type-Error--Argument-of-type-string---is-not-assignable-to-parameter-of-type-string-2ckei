This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function that takes a single string argument and returns a string.  The error occurs when the program attempts to pass an array of strings to the function. The solution demonstrates how to correct the error by modifying the function to accept an array of strings or by iterating over the array and passing each string individually to the function.
